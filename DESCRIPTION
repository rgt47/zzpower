Description: A comprehensive 'Shiny' application for conducting power analysis 
    and sample size calculations for two-group parallel clinical trial designs.
    Supports multiple effect size specifications including standardized differences,
    percentage reductions, difference in change scores, and treatment group changes.
    Accounts for dropout rates, unequal group allocation ratios, and provides
    interactive visualizations and downloadable reports. Designed for clinical
    researchers and statisticians planning randomized controlled trials.
